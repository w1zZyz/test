<li>License</li>
</ol><p>4.1. License to Services.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY DIAGRAM TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS.</p><ol start="10">
<li>Termination</li>
</ol><p>10.1. Diagram Right to Terminate. We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you.</p><p>10.2. Your Right to Terminate. You may cease use of the Services at any time. You may also cancel your Diagram account at any time by sending an email to support@diagram.com.</p><p>10.3.

Diagram will not be liable for or be considered to be in breach of or default under these Terms on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as it uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove those causes of non-performance. If Diagram believes in good faith that it is legally prohibited from providing you or your Authorized Users with the Services, we may freeze your account and/or cancel your subscription at Diagram’s sole discretion.</p><p>11.3. Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Diagram under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Diagram: (i) via e-mail; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p><p>11.4. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof and it is the intent and agreement of the parties that these Terms will be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting another provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.</p><p>11.5. Assignment. These Terms (and your access to any of the Services) are not assignable or transferable by you without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is null and void.</p><p>11.6. Service Providers. For the avoidance of doubt, Diagram may engage third parties as service providers to the Services.</p><p>11.7. No Partnership. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.</p><p>11.8.
